# Youtube AV Sync Chrome Extension
![](img/icon128.png)
### What does it do?
   On Windows, there is always a delay when streaming audio from your device to another receiver (Apple TV, AirPlay speaker, Sonos, Network Player, Bluetooth, etc.) This is causing the video and audio to be out of sync.
  
  This Chrome Extension attempts to solve this issue only for YouTube by allowing the user to adjust the audio delay so it becomes in sync with the video.
   The extension also integrates with TuneBlade so it is possible to control the connection to AirPlay devices without leaving the browser.

### How does it work?
   The original audio is muted, the extension loads the audio again so that it can be adjusted based on the delay. Only the audio is loaded twice, the video loads only one time.
